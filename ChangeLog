1.7.1
	2011-04-03

	Remove Rack::Throttle. It was added because the site used to load
	content from other sites on every page hit which is no longer the case.

	Use ActiveRecord ConnectionManagement middleware to free database
	connections. Database connections were never being returned to the
	connection pool causing a major performance issue.

	Only run PostRank::URI.clean on http and https urls. It was corrupting

	Update to jQuery 1.5.2.

	Do not show the same thumbnail for two consecutive urls.

	If there is no text selection on the current page, send an empty title
	when adding from the bookmarklet. This will cause the server side to
	fetch the title and run it through plugins.

	Escape password in bookmarklet javascript.
